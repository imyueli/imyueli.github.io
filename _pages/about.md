I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Computing, School of Advanced Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. I lead the [Heritage, Edutainment, and Reality Laboratory (HER Lab)](https://hiherlab.github.io/).

My research interest is in the field of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, with particular emphasis on **Extended Reality (XR)** technologies. I have been actively involved in research related to the design, evaluation, and application of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) in cultural heritage and education. 

I received my PhD degree from the **University of Nottingham** in 2020 with the Postgraduate Award. During my PhD study, I worked at the NVIDIA Joint-Lab on Mixed Reality in Ningbo, China and the Mixed Reality Lab in Nottingham, UK.

I have received several prestigious research grants, including the Young Scientist Programme of the **National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)** and the General Programme of the **Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China**. My scholarly contributions are published in esteemed international journals and conferences such as IEEE TVCG, ACM ToCHI, IJHCI, ACM JoCCH, IEEE VR, IEEE ISMAR, ACM CHI, and so on. I serve as the China Country Representative at the IFIP Technical Committee on Human–Computer Interaction (TC13). I also hold executive member roles in the CCF Technical Committees of HCI and VR and Visualization. I am a professional member of BCS, ACM, IEEE, and IET. 

My commitment to the field is underscored by my regular service and engagement as an editorial board member, program committee member, and reviewer for international journals and conferences. Currently I am an **Associate Editor** of [Interacting with Computers](https://academic.oup.com/iwc) and [PRESENCE: Virtual and Augmented Reality](https://direct.mit.edu/pvar). I served as the Online Experience Co-Chair in IEEE VR 2023, the Student Competition Co-Chair in IEEE ISMAR 2023, the Poster Co-Chair in IEEE AIxVR 2024, and the XR Gallery Co-Chair in IEEE VR 2026.
